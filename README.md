# hackme

Hackme is a Mendix app with security flaws. It is built with defects to show different types of security weaknesses. We want to create awareness of security and serve as knowledge base on building secure apps.

## Usage

There are three ways you can use this project:

1. [Adventure game mode](hackme-game)
2. [Modeling faults and advises](hackme-solutions)
3. [Security reference and best practices](hackme-reference)

## Contribution

We are always looking to educate each other and create awareness for security. You can contribute by promoting this awareness or help create more scenarios.

## Live environment

We have a live environment for you to play with which gets reset every 24 hours. It's accessible at:

[hackme.demo.cinaq.com](https://hackme.demo.cinaq.com)

Feel free to hack inside the app.
